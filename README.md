# RefillMatrix

## About The Project

RefillMatrix is a compatibility matrix that provides a clear overview of which refill filaments fit on which reusable master spools. The goal is to make it easier for 3D printing enthusiasts to find the right combination of spools and refills to reduce plastic waste and save costs.

The data is visualized in a simple, interactive table and is based on community experience.
